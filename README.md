Google Cloud services from C++.

The samples in this repo cover only a _small fraction_ of the total APIs that you can call from C++.
See the [googleapis repo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) to see the full list of APIs callable from C++.

These samples will only build and run on **Linux**.

There are also hand written client libraries for some services as follows:

* [google-cloud-cpp](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp) Storage and Bigtable
* [google-cloud-cpp-spanner](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp) Cloud Spanner

Those repos also have code samples for using those libraries.
